## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Rob Conery and I love working with frontend frameworks as well as databases - especially SQLite!

## Recent Projects

I'm just getting ramped up here, and I hope this list grows! Right now, I'm focusing on...

 - [Pogo](https://github.com/bobconery/Pogo). I love the NeDB project but it's been archived, so this is built with the same idea, but uses SQLite as a backend. It should work with any LibSQL infrastructure, including Turso and others.
